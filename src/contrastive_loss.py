contrastive_loss.py
--------------------
Implements the contrastive objective for SFA-CA, adapted from OTBDetector's
contrastive strategy (La Cava & Tagarelli, EMNLP 2025).

Goal: teach the model that texts from the SAME generator should have
similar embeddings EVEN ACROSS DIFFERENT SCRIPTS/CLUSTERS, while texts
from DIFFERENT generators should have different embeddings WITHIN the
same cluster. This is what should let a Latin-trained notion of
"what GPT-3.5 sounds like" transfer to Cyrillic or Arabic text.

We use a standard supervised contrastive loss (SupCon-style): within a
batch, for each sample, positives are all other samples with the same
generator label; negatives are all samples with a different label.
